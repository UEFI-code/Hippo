# Hippo Memory's Feature Simulation Program

## Motivation

I have read a book about [human brain's work mechanism](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/%E4%BA%BA%E7%B1%BB%E5%A4%A7%E8%84%91%E7%9A%84%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B.html?id=uPbfAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y), then I came out an Idea to code this with PyTorch. I added Curiousity Code to make it better.

Maybe useful in the future robotic technology.
